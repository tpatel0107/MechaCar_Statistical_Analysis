# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Module 15 Challenge
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
## Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? Vehicle_weight,spoiler_angle and AWD provide non random amount of variance. 
    **The maximum random variance was provided by ground_clearence and vehicle_length
## Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
    **Since p-value is less than zero (5.35e-11), the slope is not equal to zero
## Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 
    **The R squared value is 71.49% which implies that roughly 72% of the time the predictions will be correct using the linear model
